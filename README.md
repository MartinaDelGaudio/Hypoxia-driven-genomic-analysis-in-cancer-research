# Hypoxia driven genomic analysis in cancer research

Cancer development is a complex journey where normal cells evolve into malignant tumors through a series of gene mutations. These mutations create a diverse landscape of cancer sub-types, influenced significantly by the tumor's microenvironment. One of the critical factors in this microenvironment is hypoxia, which refers to a low-oxygen state that can significantly alter tumor cell behavior. Understanding how hypoxia affects cancer cells is crucial for advancing cancer research and treatment.

## 🧪 Research Goals
- **Single-Cell RNA Sequencing**: Analyze gene expression under hypoxic (1% oxygen) and normoxic (20% oxygen) conditions.
- **Model Training**: Use Smart-Seq2 and Drop-Seq techniques to classify cells based on oxygen levels.

## 🧩 Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis 📊
- Data Cleaning 🧹
- Normalization 🔄
- Feature Analysis 🔍
- Model Training 🤖

## 📈 Findings
- **Best Model**: LinearSVM achieved perfect accuracy in classifying hypoxic vs. normoxic cells.
- **Top Genes**: Unique gene profiles for HCC1086 and MCF7, with notable genes like CA9 and CYP1B1.
