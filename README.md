# Hypoxia driven genomic analysis in cancer research

Cancer development is a complex journey where normal cells evolve into malignant tumors through a series of gene mutations. These mutations create a diverse landscape of cancer sub-types, influenced significantly by the tumor's microenvironment. One of the critical factors in this microenvironment is hypoxia, which refers to a low-oxygen state that can significantly alter tumor cell behavior. Understanding how hypoxia affects cancer cells is crucial for advancing cancer research and treatment.

## üß™ Research Goals
- **Gene expression**: Analyze gene expression under hypoxic (1% oxygen) and normoxic (20% oxygen) conditions.
- **Model Training**: Use gene expression to classify new cells as normoxic or hypoxic.

## üß© Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis üìä
- Data Cleaning üßπ
- Normalization üîÑ
- Feature Analysis üîç
- Model Training ü§ñ

## üìà Key Findings
- **Optimal Model**: The Linear SVM model demonstrated perfect accuracy in distinguishing between hypoxic and normoxic cells.
- **Significant Genes**: Certain genes provided more valuable insights than others, with distinctive gene profiles identified for HCC1086 and MCF7. Notably, genes such as CA9 and CYP1B1 were highlighted for their relevance across both cell lines.
